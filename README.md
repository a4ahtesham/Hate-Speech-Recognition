# Hate-Speech-Recognition


This project aims to detect and classify hate speech in textual data using machine learning techniques. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning algorithms, the system is capable of analyzing user-generated content—such as tweets, comments, or messages—and identifying whether it contains hate speech or offensive language.

The workflow includes data preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization), model training on labeled datasets, and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Popular machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Naive Bayes were explored and implemented.

The goal of this project is to contribute to a safer online environment by enabling automated moderation and flagging of harmful content in real-time applications.
